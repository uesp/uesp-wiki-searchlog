SearchLog
Dave Humphrey (dave@uesp.net)

This is a basic MediaWiki extension to log all search queries made on the wiki to the database
with a simple interface at Special:SearchLog. It is not meant for production and care should be
taken when using. In particular, the custom searchlog table can get very large on busy wikis and
should be cleared of older entries regularily (see the clear-searchlog.weekly.sql script).

Installation outside of the UESP.net wiki is not explicitly supported but the general steps are
as follows:

1. Copy extension to your extensions/SearchLog/ directory.
2. Run the searchlog.sql script on your wiki database to create the custom tables.
3. Add the line:
      require_once( "$IP/extensions/SearchLog/SearchLog.php" );
   to your LocalSettings.php file.
4. Test by running some searches and visting your Special:SearchLog page.
